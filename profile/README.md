## What is Codex?
The codex project is our most advanced project to date. Our platform includes a website that allows users to effortlessly monitor their elo, create personalized profiles, earn badges, and showcase their achievements. Additionally, our custom r6tracker for White Noise offers seamless tracking of opponents' statistics, providing valuable insights during gameplay. To enhance the user experience, we have developed a dedicated Discord bot that streamlines the queueing process and ensures that MMR changes are accurately reflected on the website.
